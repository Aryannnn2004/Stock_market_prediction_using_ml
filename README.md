# Stock Market Prediction using Machine Learning

## Description

This project aims to predict stock market prices using machine learning algorithms. The project leverages data from the stock market, including historical prices, indicators, and other financial data to build predictive models. The main goal is to forecast future stock prices and analyze the trends to make informed investment decisions.

### Key Features:
- **Stock Data Collection**: The project uses `yfinance` to fetch historical stock data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- **Modeling**: Implements machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more.
- **Prediction**: Predicts future stock prices based on trained models.
- **Visualization**: Provides clear visualizations of stock trends using `matplotlib`.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: An interactive UI for users to input stock tickers and view predictions.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - **Keras**: Deep learning library for model building.
  - **TensorFlow**: Backend for Keras.
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
  - **yfinance**: Fetching stock market data.
  - **Streamlit**: Interactive web interface.
  - **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
  - **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and preprocessing.
- **IDE/Editor**: Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock_Market_Prediction_ML.git
cd Stock_Market_Prediction_ML
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows**:

  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **On macOS/Linux**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Required Libraries

Install the dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should include the necessary libraries for the project. Here's an example of what it might look like:

```
keras
tensorflow
pandas
yfinance
streamlit
matplotlib
scikit-learn
```

## Usage

### 1. **Running the Machine Learning Model**

To run the script and see the prediction output:

```bash
python stock_prediction_model.py
```

This will fetch stock data, train the machine learning model, and display the predictions.

### 2. **Streamlit Web Interface**

To run the Streamlit interactive dashboard, which allows users to input stock tickers and visualize predictions:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open a new tab in your browser with the Streamlit app, where you can:
- Enter stock ticker symbols (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple).
- View visualizations of stock data.
- See the predicted stock prices for the upcoming days.

## Model Explanation

### 1. **Data Collection**:
Using the `yfinance` library, historical stock price data is downloaded for a specified range (e.g., 5 years).

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**:
The data is cleaned by removing missing values, and features are engineered to make predictions, such as adding moving averages or relative strength index (RSI).

### 3. **Model Training**:
Several machine learning models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, are trained on the data to predict future stock prices. Each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).

### 4. **Prediction**:
Once trained, the models can predict the future stock prices based on the trained data. The predictions are then visualized using `matplotlib`.
